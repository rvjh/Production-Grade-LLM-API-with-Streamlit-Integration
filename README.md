# Production-Grade-LLM-API-with-Streamlit-Integration

This project demonstrates the creation of a production-ready API that leverages a large language model (LLM) and integrates seamlessly with a user-friendly Streamlit frontend. The LLM chosen for this example is Ollama, an open-source model known for its versatility and potential. However, the provided code can be easily adapted to work with other LLMs as well.

### Key Technologies:

Langchain: Provides a comprehensive foundation for building LLM applications.
Streamlit: Simplifies the development of interactive data applications, ideal for visualizing LLM outputs.
FastAPI: Enables the creation of high-performance RESTful APIs for LLM services.
uvicorn: Serves FastAPI applications efficiently.
python-dotenv: Facilitates secure management of environment variables.
sse-starlette: Enhances real-time communication through server-sent events.
